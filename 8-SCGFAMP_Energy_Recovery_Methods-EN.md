# SCGFAMP – Energy Recovery and Valorization Methods

_(Technical translation from French to English; June 2025)_

## 1. Mechanical and Gravitational Methods

- Descending rigid mass (gravity) with trapdoors: recovery through translation or air compression.  
- Inverted Archimedes thrust (water column) converted into mechanical displacement.  
- Energy storage in springs or hydraulic cylinders through passive cycles.  
- Clock‑inspired passive system: spring energy slowly released.  
- Ratchet wheel or escapement mechanism for regulated flow.  
- Counterweight raised or laterally shifted for energy recovery.

## 2. Embedded Micro‑Production

- Thermoelectric generators (TEG) exploiting the air‑to‑water temperature gradient.  
- Triboelectric generators driven by evaporation or condensation.  
- Micro‑piezoelectric harvesters on trapdoor, lever or guide‑rod movements.  
- Low‑flow hydro turbine on the descending water column.  
- Micro‑biological cells producing bio‑energy in stagnant water.

## 3. Conversion and Transmission Systems

- Mini linear generators (magnets + coils) along vertical travel paths.  
- Pneumatic cylinders converting mechanical motion to electricity.  
- Mechanical harvesting from the oscillation of floating modules.  
- Inter‑module mechanical chains with amplified transmission (Modules E / E+ / E++).

## 4. Strategic Boosts and Optimizations

- Passive recompression of air (return‑to‑useful‑pressure systems).  
- Mechanical amplification via motion multipliers or levers.  
- Shape‑memory modules adapting buoyancy with temperature.  
- Self‑aligning modules guided by ultrasonic sensors for cycle optimization.  
- Regulation using magnetorheological fluids.

## 5. Automation and Active Re‑use

- Intelligent interconnected modules (PRIMARY GRID → MAINTENANCE → PROLIFERATION).  
- Self‑powered microcontrollers for diagnostics and monitoring.  
- Digital twins for instant energy modelling and control.  
- Click‑&‑Play modules for simplified maintenance.

## 6. Prospective and Futuristic Ideas

- Magnetic fluid couplings for watertight hydraulic power transfer.  
- Triboelectric or MEMS sensors embedded on all moving parts.  
- Non‑moving‑part fluid valve with plasma assistance for active regulation.  
- Microporous‑foam filtration recovering flow energy.

## 7. Regulation, Synchronization and System Safety

- Dual‑safety air/water purge mechanisms: purge valve + ejector.  
- Residual water reservoir to prevent air pockets and loss of prime.  
- Passive one‑way valve as an alternative to a buffer chamber for pressure compensation.  
- Hybrid redundancy: buffer chamber combined with one‑way valve.  
- Thermal regulator “ThermoLung”: cyclic air expansion/contraction via solar heat.  
- Passive monitoring by mechanical ratchet or floating threshold (self‑trigger).  
- Passive membrane pressure sensors driving a mechanical safety control.
