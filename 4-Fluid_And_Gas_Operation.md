# 🔬 Biomimetic Operation – Fluid and Gas Flow Mechanism

This system is inspired by a **mechanical lung**—not to replicate a biological organ, but to **mimic its passive cyclic behavior**.  
It is based on pressure differences, air compressibility, gravity, and one-way valves.

## 🫁 1. Inhalation

- When the pressure in the air column drops below a critical threshold (e.g., < 0.7 bar), an **air intake opens automatically**, allowing atmospheric air (1 bar) to enter.
- Air enters the air column, which:
  - restores internal pressure (towards 1 bar),
  - initiates the **displacement of excess water** present in the column (due to prior flow through the one-way valves from the water column).
- This return to atmospheric pressure helps **push water back** into the water column.

🔁 This phase acts as the “inhalation” of a respiratory system: air intake = pressure regulation = fluid movement.

## 🌬️ 2. Exhalation

- In the previous phase, water entered the air column → **occupying part of the volume initially held by air**.
- As air is compressible, it is **not forcibly expelled** but **naturally redistributes**:
  - It shifts toward available spaces—some of which may be in the **connected water column**.
  - This redistribution occurs passively due to **volume and pressure balance**.
- The air that enters the water column is then **vented through a purge valve**, which:
  - reduces pressure in that column,
  - creates a **partial vacuum** that facilitates water inflow in the next cycle.

🔁 This phase corresponds to “exhalation”: excess air is purged, and vacuum is created.

## 🔁 Passive Cycle Summary

1. **Pressure drop** in air column → atmospheric air enters  
2. Air regulates pressure and **pushes water** back into its original column  
3. Water **returns to the air column** (via valves) → air compresses  
4. Some air **redistributes into the water column** (volume effect)  
5. Air is **purged**, generating a **new vacuum**  
6. Vacuum helps **pull water back** into the water column  
7. 🔄 The cycle restarts

## 📌 Technical Notes

This system includes:
- no motors  
- no pumps  
- no active mechanical components

It relies on:
- pressure laws and gas compressibility,  
- gravity and buoyancy of fluids,  
- a set of one-way valves to control flow direction.

⚠️ Actual performance will highly depend on:
- volumes and proportions,  
- system geometry,  
- timing and sync of each phase,  
- overall system tightness (leak-proof design).

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This is **not claimed to be a standalone energy device**, but rather an **experimental prototype**:  
> A passive fluidic gravity-buoyancy cycle, inspired by natural breathing, for exploration, testing, and improvement.
