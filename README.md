# SCGFAMP – Gravitoflotation Cycle with Passive Magnetic Assistance

SCGFAMP is a **freely accessible system for non-commercial use**, accompanied by a **dedicated commercial license**. It is not an open-source project in the strict sense (e.g., MIT, GPL), but rather a **pseudo-open system with clear usage boundaries**.

## 💡 Purpose
To provide a low-tech, scalable, modular technological foundation for energy or mechanical transfer, available for public use under non-commercial terms, and licensed for entities seeking private or strategic benefits.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The system operates at low pressure (< 1 bar), though the concept can be adapted to other pressure ranges. The cycle is based on:

- A **gravitational-flotation cyclic system** with **passive magnetic assistance**
- An **air intake** into the air column (from outside atmosphere, driven by pressure differential)
- An **air outlet (purge)** in the water column
- A mechanism to **expel water that entered the air column**, either through **incoming air pressure** or the motion of the falling mass
- A **mass** switching columns via a **trapdoor or valve system**
- The mass **falls in the air column** (gravity) and **rises in the water column** (buoyancy)
- A **buffer chamber** (or flexible membrane) compensates water volume fluctuations

The result is a **circular cycle of a mass** (gravity → trapdoor → buoyancy → trapdoor, in loop), which causes **fluid and air displacement**. This is regulated by the **air intake**, **air purge**, and **water expulsion**, maintaining global entropic balance.

### 🔬 Scientific Clarification

> ❗️**SCGFAMP is not a perpetual motion machine.**
>
> The system is based on natural physical cycles using gravity, buoyancy, and air/fluid regulation, within a closed environment.
>
> It requires external input (design configuration, occasional rebalancing, air intake from the atmosphere) and experiences energy losses (fluid friction, heat, mechanical resistance).
>
> The goal is not to create energy from nothing, but to **manage transfers and recoveries of mechanical/pressure energy** in an accessible, low-tech format.
>
> SCGFAMP is experimental, educational, and intended to stimulate biomimetic innovation — not to defy thermodynamic laws.
