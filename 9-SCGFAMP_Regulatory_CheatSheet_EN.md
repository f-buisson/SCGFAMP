# SCGFAMP — Regulatory Cheat‑Sheet (Pressure Domains)

*Plain‑English, section format — Updated: June 2025*

---

## Domain A — Near‑Atmospheric (ΔP ≤ 0.5 bar g)

**EU (Europe)**  
  • Outside the Pressure Equipment Directive (PED 2014/68/EU) because gauge pressure is below 0.5 bar.  
  • If moving parts are present, apply the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC.  

**USA / Canada**  
  • ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC VIII) is **not** mandatory.  
  • OSHA “General Duty” clause may still apply.  

**Key Design Notes**  
  • Vessel is considered non‑hazardous.  
  • Verify resistance to fatigue and possible implosion of flat panels.

---

## Domain B — Partial Vacuum (0.5 – 1 bar abs)

**EU**  
  • Still outside PED, but vacuum design rules apply.  
  • Use EN 13445‑3, Annex G (Calculation of unfired pressure vessels subject to external pressure).  

**USA / Canada**  
  • Follow API STD 620, Appendix R for tanks in vacuum service.  

**Key Design Notes**  
  • Main risk is buckling of walls; install vacuum stiffening rings ≥ 0.7 m diameter.  
  • Provide a calibrated vacuum breaker or relief valve.

---

## Domain C — Deep Vacuum (0.2 – 0.5 bar abs)

**EU**  
  • Same standards as Domain B plus the EU “Pressure Equipment Safety Guidance – Vacuum Vessels”.  

**USA / Canada**  
  • Same approach as Domain B; see CFR‑29 §1910 for occupational safety.  

**Key Design Notes**  
  • Water may boil or degas at room temperature; cavitation risk.  
  • Mandatory: isolate vacuum pump and fit a quick‑acting relief device.

---

## Domain D — Positive Pressure (> 0.5 bar g up to 2 bar abs)

**EU**  
  • **Inside PED 2014/68/EU**.  
  • Category depends on the product *PV* (pressure × volume) with Fluid Group 2 (air/water).  
    — PV < 200 bar·L → **Category I** — self‑certification allowed.  
    — 200 ≤ PV ≤ 1 000 bar·L → **Category II** — Notified Body approval (Module A2).  

**USA / Canada**  
  • **ASME BPVC Section VIII, Division 1** is required in most jurisdictions.  
  • Canadian installations need CRN registration.  

**Key Design Notes**  
  • Perform a hydrostatic (or pneumatic) test at ≥ 1.3 × design pressure.  
  • Apply CE marking or the ASME “UM” stamp as appropriate.

> **How to use this cheat‑sheet**  
> 1. Identify your expected internal absolute pressure.  
> 2. Locate the matching domain above.  
> 3. Follow the listed standards and design notes to determine whether you need self‑certification or third‑party inspection.
