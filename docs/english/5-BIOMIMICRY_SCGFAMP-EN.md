BIOMIMICRY ‚Äì SCGFAMP

ü´Å Biomimetic Inspiration: The Human Lung

The SCGFAMP system is directly inspired by the human respiratory cycle:

‚Ä¢ Passive Atmospheric Air Intake:

When internal pressure drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.7 bar), a valve automatically opens to allow outside air to enter the system ‚Äî similar to how lungs inhale air.

‚Ä¢ Internal Transformation:

The air drawn in is used to produce mechanical or energy-related work (e.g., regulate or powering a mechanism). This step mirrors how oxygen is used in the human body‚Äôs metabolism.

‚Ä¢ Expulsion:

Once the air has been used or becomes disruptive to the cycle, it is evacuated through a purge system. This is similar to how the body exhales carbon dioxide and waste gases.

This design forms a simple, low-maintenance loop: inhale ‚Äì transform ‚Äì exhale. It offers a natural pedagogical analogy drawn from living systems and supports passive and autonomous operation.
