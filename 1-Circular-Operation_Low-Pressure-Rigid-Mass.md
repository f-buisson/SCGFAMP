SCGFAMP â€“ Low Pressure Version with Rigid Air-Filled Mass

Introduction

This document describes the detailed operation of the SCGFAMP system in its simplest and most realistic configuration: low air pressure (< 1 bar) and a rigid hollow body filled with air. This design improves mechanical stability and minimizes fragile components.

Operating Cycle

1. Fall in the air column (0.7 bar):- The rigid body, denser than air, falls due to gravity.- It gains enough momentum to pass through the lower trapdoor.

2. Passing through the lower trapdoor:- Momentum triggers the mechanical opening of the trapdoor.- A magnet located just below the trap assists in opening.- The mass enters the water column.

3. Ascent in the water:- Buoyancy exceeds the total weight of the mass.- The mass rises naturally to the top.

4. Return to the air column:- At the top, a magnet attracts the mass toward the air column entry.- The mass pushes the upper trapdoor and returns to the drop position.

Air/Water Leakage Management

- During each trap passage, a small amount of water enters the air column.- Some air escapes into the water column.

ðŸ”„ Automatic air purge in the water column:- Removes unwanted air that entered accidentally.- Works without any external energy.

ðŸ’¨ Air-impulse water ejection system:- Ejects infiltrated water from the air column back into the water column.- Maintains a small water reserve to fill the vacuum left by purged air.

Hydraulic Buffer Chamber

- When the mass enters the water, it pushes water upward.- A buffer chamber at the top absorbs this volume shift.- Prevents overpressure on the upper trapdoor.- Contains compressible air or a partially open volume.

Air Column Pressure Regulator

- Ensures a minimum pressure of 0.7 bar in the air column.- A passive valve opens when pressure drops too low.- Outside air enters until balance is restored, then the valve closes.

Conclusion

The SCGFAMP, in its low-pressure and rigid-mass version, is a passive, autonomous mechanical system. It works without motors or electronics by balancing physical forces and using simple mechanisms (trapdoors, magnets, purge system, buffer chamber, regulator).
